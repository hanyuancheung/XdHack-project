> The background of our project is that, when customers are scanning products offline, they always spend a lot of time hanging around and search the suitable store or products. According to that fact, we decide to develop an application of this field and help all guys missed find their wonderful clothes or delicious.

### Total framework of our project is that:

1. Capture the purchase behaviour's data from customers through BaiDu Camera, we can get how many customers right here and note everyone's ID code. Besides, store all the data from our camera and make an analysis.

2. Then we'll take an OCR which stands for Optical Character Recognition, to detecte the nearby stores and take them down in our database. At the same time , we can get the data where the similar person with you have entered. 

3. According to stored customers data, we can make a personal recommandation based on Collaborative Filtering Algorithem and provide customers what they might like as well as where gonna be.
